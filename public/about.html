<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Nayara, a recently graduated professional in Communication Sciences, with a great passion for the area. In 2023, at the age of 22, I enthusiastically completed my degree, where I experienced countless challenges. In order to combine my creative sense, digital and communication, in July 2023 I enrolled in a postgraduate course in User Experience Design while also taking an online Bootcamp in Web Development.</p>

<p>I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a professional and as a person. With dedication and enthusiasm, I am ready to contribute to innovative projects and make a difference in the digital world.</p>

<p>With this beginning of the cycle I decided to create this portfolio, which will be constantly evolving to showcase my best work.</p>

<p>Having said that, <br />
  
  Welcome to my portfolio, I hope you enjoy the journey I've built so far!</p>
